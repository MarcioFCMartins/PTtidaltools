\title{Calculate estimated tide heights}
\usage{
interpolate_tides(date_times = NULL, port_id = 19, timezone = "local")
}
\arguments{
\item{date_times}{A character vector with the format yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss OR a POSIXct vector of date-time points for which tidal height will be estimated.}

\item{port_id}{The id code for the desired port (use port_list to see a list, Faro-Olh√£o is the default)}

\item{timezone}{The timezone used for `date_times`. Must be one of "local" (which includes time changes due to daylight savings) or "UTC".}
}
\description{
This function interpolates tides at given time points for any port covered by 
the National Hydrographic Institute.
}
\details{
You must specify the port ID and provide the list of date-time points for which
tidal height should be estimated.

It returns the expected tide height at those time-points, for that port
based on the method provided by the Portuguese National Hydrographic Institute.
}
\examples{
Retrieve the information for the Faro - Olhao port, for the 7 days after March 5th of 2020.
sampling_times <- c("2020-03-13 15:15:00", "2020-03-09 16:15:00")
interpolate_tides(port_id = 19, date_times = sampling_times, timezone = "local")
}
