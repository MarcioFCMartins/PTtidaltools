# tidytides
R package to read and process tidal data from the Portuguese National Hydrographic Institute

to-do: 
  fix interpolation when non-consecutive days are given to interpolate_tides
  improve documentation, make the difference between valid_ports and get_port_ids clear (change names too, probably)
